# Probit Regression Plot
A tool to create probit regression model and its graphical plot with confidence interval

## Dataset
The dataset provided "pseudoabsence_diagnostic_performance" is pseudodata created to mimic the diagnostic performance of an antibody detection kit. The column details are:
- antibody_conc: antibody concentration (mg/mL)
- positive: positive detection (1 is positive, 0 is negative (undetected))

## Features
- Fit probit regression models
- Generate graphical plots with confidence intervals

## Future Plans
- Add feature to calculate probabilities and confidence intervals for specific X-axis values

## Contribute
We welcome feedback and suggestions for future features! Open an issue or pull request on the project repository.
